Hi there!

Post-1.2.1, compiling THUD has switched to use Apache ant, a sophisticated
compilation tool.

If ant is installed, you should be able to just run 'ant' from the directory 
this file's in to compile THUD to a .jar file.

If you want to edit the source files, a Java-specific integrated development 
environment (IDE) such as Eclipse is highly recommended.

To set up the project to edit and compile under Eclipse:
1) File -> New -> Other...
2) Select 'Java Project from Existing Ant Buildfile'
3) Enter a descriptive project name and in the 'Ant buildfile' box, navigate to
   the 'build.xml' file located in this directory
4) Hit 'Finish' and you're all set!

If you are interested in working on the THUD client, join our developer's
mailing list and introduce yourself! We can always use the help.

Thanks,
