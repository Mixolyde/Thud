1.1  ---
New Features/Changes:
 - Selection now uses an easier-to-spot red-black dash instead of just a thick black line
 - Selection now selects multiple hexes by default (you don't need to hold shift down). Control-clicking will deselect all when using the select tool.
 - Control/Command-1,2,3,4,5 now select brush size
 
Bug Fixes:
 - Cancel button on 'New Map' dialog box now works
 - All keystrokes are now part of the menu system (new 'Tool' menu). This should make them more robust.
 
Performance Improvements:
 - Zooming, scrolling, and drawing hexes are all much faster
